## API Key Setup

This project uses the WeatherAPI.com service. To fetch weather data, you need an API key.

1.  Create a file named `config.js` inside the `js/` directory.
2.  Add the following content to `js/config.js`, replacing `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key:
    ```javascript
    const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
    ```
3.  The `js/config.js` file is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to version control.

## Running Tests

Basic unit tests are located in `js/tests/main.test.js`. To run these tests:

1.  Ensure you have set up your API key as described above (though tests for `updateUVIndex` don't require the API key to run).
2.  Manually add the test script to your `index.html` file before the closing `</body>` tag:
    ```html
    <script src="js/tests/main.test.js"></script>
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
4.  Open the browser's developer console to see the test results.
